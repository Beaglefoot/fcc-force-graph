# Show National Contiguity with a Force Directed Graph
[The fourth project in Data Visualization section on freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/show-national-contiguity-with-a-force-directed-graph)

User Stories:

* I can see a Force-directed Graph that shows which countries share borders.
* I can see each country's flag on its node.

In addition you can zoom and safely drag flags over svg borders.
